    <h2>ABOUT PAGE</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
        I'm Falodun Oluwadamilola, shortened as Dami, I am 20 years old and currently a final year student of Management & Accounting, Obafemi Awolowo University. I started my coding journey late 2020 with python and HTML and fortunately I fell for it and decided to aim at being a Fullstack Developer, well not there yet but soon... When I'm not coding, I love sports and games, especially football(soccer), a big fan of anime and movies. Arigato..
